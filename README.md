## About 

This package allows you to retrieve an uploaded image object from request, apply
manipulations over the image content and then place the result to file storage.

Under the hud this package uses the [Intervention Image](http://image.intervention.io/) -
a PHP image handling and manipulation library.

## Basic Usage

For example your app has a controller that handles the users' avatars uploads 
and saves the avatar images to file storage ('s3', local 'public' storage, or
whatever else). You want that avatars to fit to 250x250 pixels square and to
be encoded into PNG format before puting to storage.

This can be done as easy as:

```php
$request->image('avatar')
	->fit(250, 250)
	->encode('png')
	->store('images/users/avatars', 's3');
```

The `$request` object (and also the `Request` facade) now have an `image`
method, that works like the `file` method - retrieves the image file from the
input as an instance of `Vinterskogen\UploadedImage\Uploadedimage` class. 

This class extends the Laravel's `Illuminate\Http\UploadedFile` and implements
a number of helpful image handling methods.

### Basic image handling methods

The list of public methods that are available on `Uploadedimage`:

- `crop(int $width, int $height, int $x = null, int $y = null)` - crop uploaded
  image to given width and height
- `encode(string $format, int $quality = null)` - encode uploaded image in given
format and quality
- `scale(int|float $percentage)` - scale the uploaded image size using given
percentage
- `resizeToWidth(int $width)` - resize the uploaded image to new width,
  constraining aspect ratio
- `resizeToHeight(int $height)` - resize the uploaded image to new height,
  constraining aspect ratio
- `fit(int $width, int $height)` - resize and crop the uploaded image to fit a
  given dimensions, keeping aspect ratio
- `height()` - get height in pixels of uploaded image
- `width()` - get width in pixels of uploaded image
