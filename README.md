Gracefully deal with resizing, cropping and scaling uploaded images in Laravel
apps.

## About

This package allows you to retrieve an uploaded image object from request, apply
manipulations over the image content and then place the result to file storage
in a few lines of code.

Under the hood this package is using [Intervention Image](http://image.intervention.io/) -
a PHP image handling and manipulation library.

## Installation

Install via Composer:

`composer require vinterskogen/laravel-uploaded-image`

Check the [Installation](docs/installation.md) page for full information about
package requirements and notes.

## Basic Usage

For example your app has a controller that handles the users' avatars uploads 
and saves the avatar images to file storage (cloud, local 'public' storage,
etc.).

You want that avatars to fit to 250x250 pixels square and to be encoded
into PNG format before putting to storage.

This can be done as easy as:

```php
$request->image('avatar')
        ->fit(250, 250)
        ->encode('png')
        ->store('images/users/avatars', 'public');
```

The `$request` object (and also the `Request` facade) now have an `image`
method, that works just like the `file` method - retrieves an image file from the
input and returns it as an instance of `Vinterskogen\UploadedImage\Uploadedimage`
class. 

This class extends the Laravel's `Illuminate\Http\UploadedFile` and implements
a number of helpful image handling methods.

**Note**: 

To be sure the file you are going to handle like an image is actually an image 
file, you have to apply [request form validation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/validation#form-request-validation)
constraints on your controller's input (if you haven't done that yet, of course).

### Basic image handling methods

#### Scale
